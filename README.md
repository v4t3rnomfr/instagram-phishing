## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
cd ~  # Navigate to your preferred directory
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/instagram-phishing.git
cd instagram-phishing
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Download it from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/).
